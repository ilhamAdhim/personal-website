The Front-End world never gets tired of innovating something new. Nowadays, we have lots of options to choose from if we want to build a website. In development itself, we have the main players in the field that most fellow developers are keen on. Among those available tools, are Svelte and React.
<br/>

Although the most common pattern of comparison articles is:
<br/>

<Alert status='success' variant='left-accent'>
    It depends.
</Alert>
<br/>

We will have a good look at how each performs things in their own playstyle, yet achieves something similar.

<br/>
<Text my="2" fontSize="2xl"> Write Less Code </Text>
<br/>

Svelte offers a compelling advantage over React through its concise syntax and code efficiency. Unlike React, which relies on a virtual DOM and JSX (JavaScript XML) to create and update the user interface, Svelte takes a different approach that leads to significantly leaner and more straightforward code.
<br/>

Let’s take a look at how we would create a simple app that add 2 numbers based on user input in React and Svelte
<br/>
<img style={{ width:'100%' , objectFit : 'cover', backgroundPosition: "center" }} src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/0*5a0G4z2c1tcjzHHQ.png   " alt="Jumbotron image by unsplash" />
<Box m="1em 0" textAlign="center" > How common components are written in React vs. Svelte </Box>
<br/>

In this example, we are given example of how `bind:value` in Svelte can replace the usage of `state` and `onChange` event in React JSX. This is one of many simplification that Svelte has to offer.

<br/>
<Text my="2" fontSize="2xl"> No Virtual DOM </Text>
<br/>

In the early days of web development, in order to make a website interactive with user inputs, we manipulated DOM directly with JS query selectors or JQuery.
<br/>

When modern JS Libraries come out, this idea is quite deprecated since the virtual DOM has taken over it. React and Vue became game-changer. The approach is considered to be much faster, and more importantly — for me — we don’t need to select a specific DOM element and manually update it as the data changes.
<br/>

In React, updating the virtual DOM has some steps. Such as:
<br/>

<ul>
    <li>Creating Virtual DOM </li>
    <li>DOM Diffing </li>
    <li>Reconciliation / Sync actual DOM with updated virtual DOM </li>
</ul>
<br/>

Turns out, this process <b> isn’t resources-free </b> and React will <b> need additional code </b> to make Virtual DOM exist and run properly.
<br/>

Let’s take a look at how React and Svelte handle renderings:
<br/>

<img style={{ width:'100%' , objectFit : 'cover', backgroundPosition: "center" }} src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/format:webp/1*gX9y5rQRQ52eK4mT6TvMaA.png" alt="Svelte vs React browser DOM" />
<Box m="1em 0" textAlign="center" > The approach used by React and Svelte to render a dynamic web page </Box>

In Svelte, however, it reverts directly to the DOM without us manually selecting and updating the DOM as the JQuery does.
<br/>

Svelte is actually a compiler that turns our code into highly optimized Javascript code.
<br/>

Using its component-based architecture, Svelte tracks dependencies between variables, allowing it to accurately determine when changes to one variable will affect other parts of the component.
<br/>

Due to this, Svelte won’t need some codes to make Virtual DOM. This is one of the reasons that Svelte’s app has a much smaller build size of the application to React.
<br/>

I’ve tried to develop a simple library book web app written with Svelte and React. This is how the build size compared:
<br/>

<img style={{ width:'100%' , objectFit : 'cover', backgroundPosition: "center" }} src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:640/format:webp/1*cdtlWcBEC2Q1YJg_f8_jNQ.png" alt="Svelte vs React browser DOM" />
<Box m="1em 0" textAlign="center" > Build size comparison with same app and same features for React and Svelte </Box>

<br/>
<Text my="2" fontSize="2xl"> Performance </Text>
<br/>

Optimized code from compiled Svelte code automatically ensures the reactivity element in the actual DOM.
<br/>

This is different from React in which we should care about memoizing values and functions with `useMemo` and `useCallback` to prevent unnecessary re-renders.
<br/>

I use Lighthouse to check the overall performance of my websites. Here, we can actually see how Svelte and React perform in Lighthouse:
<br/>
</div>

<img style={{ width:'100%' , objectFit : 'cover', backgroundPosition: "center" }} src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:786/0*HE2o4_3GyS3wRamZ" alt="Svelte vs React browser DOM" />
<Box m="1em 0" textAlign="center" > Lighthouse checking — Svelte App </Box>

<Box m="1em 0" textAlign="center" > Lighthouse checking — React App </Box>

<br/>
<Alert status='success' variant='left-accent'>
    Note: The result may vary in different devices and each test. In my case however, it is consistent that Svelte performance is way better than React.
</Alert>
<br/>

I didn’t apply any `useCallback()` and `useMemo()` in the React app, and not configuring anything related to performance in the Svelte app. Yet, the Svelte app has higher points compared to the React app.

<br/>
<Text my="2" fontSize="2xl"> Community Support </Text>
<br/>

Despite its superior developer experience and built-in performance, the Svelte community is relatively small compared to React. This leads to limited resources, tools, documentation, and a potential talent pool.
<br/>
While React has a more established and abundant environment to work with, Svelte has its own thriving community. Below are some references for UI Framework for Svelte:
<br/>

</ul>

<br/>
<Text my="2" fontSize="2xl"> Summary </Text>
<br/>

Whether you want to use Svelte or React, ultimately depends on the project’s scale, requirements, and the developers you have.
<br/>

If you have small to medium size applications like common CMS or CRUD applications, Svelte may be a good choice for beginners too since it has minimal learning curve and fast development time.
<br/>

However, if you have lots of developers that are proficient in React and working on large-scale projects. Using React is a natural thing to do.
<br/>

For reference, feel free to take a look at the same app I created with Svelte and React here:
<br/>

</ul>

<Text my="2" fontSize="2xl"> What’s Next ? </Text>
<br/>

We’re just comparing the React and Svelte in its first look. When it comes to Front-End Web things, it’s also important to have full-scale web app that includes SEO Optimization, Rendering Strategies (SSR / CSR / ISR), Routings, and more.
<br/>   

Next thing we’ll try to cover SvelteKit and Next JS to discuss about it. Stay tune!
