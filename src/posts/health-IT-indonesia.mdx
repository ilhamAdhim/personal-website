<div>
  Last Saturday — 4 May 2024 — I attended “Technology Startup Summit” held by
  SIMT-ITS and Sinar Mas Land which covers Revolutionizing Health through
  Digital Innovation.

<br />

<div>
  How did I get in this area? Outside of my normal 9 to 5 full-time job, I’m
  currently building my side project of E-Medical Record Web Application System
  which has been used by 10 clinics in East Java so far.

<div>
  As one of the developers, I strongly feel urgency to attend this event and
  share my findings with my peers. Mainly, it is to improve the usability of the
  app and to make it relevant with pain points the users may have.
