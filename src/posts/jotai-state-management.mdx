# Introduction
<div>
  In my early stage of learning web development, i used React Redux to handle my state management. It made me believed that state management has to be complicated and has lots of boilerplate to share data across the entire application. 
  When i explored React hooks, the idea of React context amazes me. It can be used on various kind and scope of the project, easy-to-maintain, and less complex than Redux.

# Atoms Everywhere

  Quite similar to component-based approach in React, we use <b>atoms</b> as the simplest form of state. Lorem ipsum

# Summary
In summary, consider using Jotai over React Context if you value simplicity, performance optimization, fine-grained reactivity, and predictable updates. React Context can be suitable for smaller applications or cases where complex state management is not a primary concern. However, for more advanced state management needs, alternatives like Jotai or Redux might provide more robust solutions.
