  Technology Startup Summit — Marketing Gallery, SinarMas Land Plaza BSD City{" "}
</Box>

<div>
  Last Saturday — 4 May 2024 — I attended “Technology Startup Summit” held by
  SIMT-ITS and Sinar Mas Land which covers Revolutionizing Health through
  Digital Innovation.
</div>

<br />

<div>
  How did I get in this area? Outside of my normal 9 to 5 full-time job, I’m
  currently building my side project of E-Medical Record Web Application System
  which has been used by 10 clinics in East Java so far.
</div>

<br />

<div>
  As one of the developers, I strongly feel urgency to attend this event and
  share my findings with my peers. Mainly, it is to improve the usability of the
  app and to make it relevant with pain points the users may have.
</div>

  Evolution of Halodoc from time to time{" "}

<br />

<div>
  We’re having a kind of role-model with Halodoc. Solely, they have large
  coverage of IT — Health solutions and users. In their early days, they also
  spotting some gaps in 2020 market COVID era:
</div>

<ul
  style={{
    margin: "2em",
    display: "flex",
    gap: "1em",
    flexDirection: "column",
  }}
>
  <li style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
    Limited access to doctors. By data, 1 doctor need to serve thousands of
    users. Meaning that consultation is basically hard to do in-person. From
    here, they launch consultation feature in Halodoc.
  </li>
  <li>
    Registered doctors struggles with administrative issues, getting late to
    give medical treatment to patients. From here, they launch a feature to have
    the doctor rating. With SLA booking / response time ≤ 15 mins.
  </li>
</ul>

<div>Our take on our app:</div>

<ul
  style={{
    margin: "2em",
    display: "flex",
    gap: "1em",
    flexDirection: "column",
  }}
>
  <li style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
    From 1st point, we made{" "}
    <b> e-medical record and booking process easily accessible </b> to clinic
    frontliners, doctors, and the owners.
  </li>
  <li style={{ textAlign: "justify" }}>
    From 2nd point, we adopted the idea of{" "}
    <b> recording booking time and waiting time. </b> For example, patients have
    booked at 9AM — 10 AM. But the current time is 9.15 AM, the system notifies
    the frontliner that the patient have been waiting for 15 mins. This is to
    improve service quality of the clinics. Either improve the flow, contact the
    doctor, or reschedule the patient.

      As long as you’re providing and delivering solution to users, you can
      still compete with others. My take on this, it’s better to have 2 division
      of IT perspective:
